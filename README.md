# AI Apps Collection

Welcome to the **AI Apps Collection** project! This repository is dedicated to collecting, developing, and sharing a wide range of AI-related projects and resources. The goal is to create a comprehensive hub for AI enthusiasts, developers, and researchers to explore, contribute, and learn about the latest advancements and practical applications in artificial intelligence.

## Project Vision

This project aims to become a central resource for:

- **AI Agents**: Implementations and frameworks for autonomous agents, including LLM-powered agents, multi-agent systems, and agent toolkits.
- **AI Fullstack Projects**: End-to-end applications that leverage AI in the frontend, backend, and infrastructure, showcasing real-world use cases.
- **DevOps for AI**: Tools, scripts, and best practices for deploying, monitoring, and maintaining AI systems in production environments.
- **Model Context Protocol (MCP)**: Resources and examples for integrating and using the Model Context Protocol to standardize AI model interactions.
- **Machine Learning & Deep Learning**: Notebooks, scripts, and projects covering supervised, unsupervised, and reinforcement learning, as well as neural network architectures.
- **Natural Language Processing (NLP)**: Projects and demos related to text analysis, language models, chatbots, and more.
- **Computer Vision**: Image and video analysis, object detection, segmentation, and generative models.
- **AI Infrastructure**: Guides and code for setting up scalable, efficient, and secure AI infrastructure (cloud, on-prem, hybrid).
- **AI Tools & Utilities**: Useful scripts, libraries, and utilities to accelerate AI development and experimentation.
- **Research & Papers**: Summaries, implementations, and discussions of influential AI research papers.

## Planned Structure

The repository will be organized into subfolders for each major area, for example:

- `/agents/` — AI agent frameworks and demos
- `/fullstack/` — Fullstack AI-powered applications
- `/devops/` — DevOps scripts and infrastructure-as-code for AI
- `/mcp/` — Model Context Protocol resources
- `/ml/` — Machine learning projects and notebooks
- `/nlp/` — NLP projects
- `/cv/` — Computer vision projects
- `/tools/` — Utilities and helper scripts
- `/research/` — Research paper implementations and summaries
